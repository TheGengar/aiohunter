# aiohunter
Hunter

Was going to make a AIOHunter but I think someone else already made one, who's far better at scripting than I am. As of now, all it does
is hunt salamanders, specifically Red only I think. It has some ABC2 implementation as well. I got my HCIM from 60~ to 76 hunter with this.
Going for 83 but will fix this when I have time.
